            <h2>üí´ Reconstructing Romance</h2>
            <div class="theme-content">
                <p class="lead-paragraph">When we speak of "Romance" in academia, we're not just referring to passionate love stories or genre fiction‚Äîwe're invoking a profound connection to beauty, truth, and human experience that has the power to transform both our scholarship and our world.</p>

                <div class="theme-exploration">
                    <h3>Beyond Convention</h3>
                    <p>The concept of Romance extends far beyond interpersonal relationships. It encompasses a deep appreciation for beauty in all its forms: in literature, in nature, in ideas, and in the human spirit. This broader understanding invites us to engage passionately with art, ideas, and the vast tapestry of human experience.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Community & Connection</h3>
                    <p>Community and romance are inherently intertwined. As Paulo Freire reminds us in <cite>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</cite>, "Dialogue cannot exist in the absence of a profound love for the world and for people." This love‚Äîthis romance with humanity itself‚Äîforms the cornerstone of our academic pursuit and our belief that the study of English literature can indeed help save the world.</p>

                    <h3>‚öîÔ∏è A Call to Adventure</h3>
                    <p>This conference aims to reconstruct our understanding of romance in academia‚Äîemphasizing its power to inspire adventure, foster idealism, and revitalize our approach to literature and language. We believe that romance, in its broadest sense, is not just an object of study but a methodology for engaging with texts, ideas, and each other.</p>

                    <div class="manifesto-section">
                        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                        <p>We stand at a crucial moment in academic history, where the humanities face unprecedented challenges. Yet, as Noam Chomsky reminds us, "Optimism is a strategy for making a better future." Our response is not merely defensive but transformative. We assert that the liberal arts are, indeed, the arts that liberate‚Äîliberating not just minds, but hearts and communities as well.</p>

                        <p>As Vaclav Havel observed, "Hope is a dimension of the soul." Through this conference, we explore how this dimension manifests in our scholarship, our teaching, and our community engagement. We investigate how compassion for humanity and beauty can reshape not just our academic landscapes, but our personal ones as well.</p>
